discussed in class, it can be useful to predict a disease outbreak. This can

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?
Answer: Merging combines changes from one branch into another branch. On the
other hand, rebasing moves changes from one branch onto another branch.
Merge helps to merge different git branches, while rebase integrates changes
from one branch into another.
Merge gives the complete history of commit merging, but in rebasing, the 
history is altered as commits are rebased.
